      Christmas has always been my favorite day of the year for me. <br />
      The regret that the year is coming to an end, <br />
      Weak anxiety and anticipation of the beginning of a new year, <br />
      Carols passing through the streets, <br />
      The dazzling lights of the street and the Christmas decorations, <br />
      The clothes of people who change in the face of winter, <br />
      White and beautiful snow falling from the sky, <br />
      All of these factors made me so excited about Christmas and loved it. <br />
      <br /><br /><br />
      So, as the end of the year is approaching, this project used a blender to make a Christmas cabin.
